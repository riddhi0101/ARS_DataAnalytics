# ARS_DataAnalytics

In this repository we conduct some exploratory data analysis and visualization on the sales data from the Aggie Reuse Store at UC Davis. 
The data was collected at pop-up thrift store sales during Fall Quarter 2021.  

The **Data** folder contains our sales data from the whole quarter, pre- and post-cleaning.  

The **Data-Cleaning** folder contains the Jupyter Notebook we used to process the data.  

The **Day-of-Week-Analysis** looks at the sales data faceted by date, weekday, and item category (clothing, school supplies, etc.)
There is also a comparison plot between the master price list prices of items and the actual prices they were sold for.
